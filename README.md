description about my project:During my internship, I developed an interactive quiz web application that allows users to test their knowledge through a series of multiple-choice questions. The quiz features ten questions, each with four answer options, and a 30-second countdown timer to add a sense of urgency. The app dynamically tracks the user's score and displays their final results upon completion. I built the project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, where HTML structured the layout, CSS enhanced the design for a clean and engaging look, and JavaScript handled the quiz logic, including question transitions, answer validation, and the countdown timer.

One of the challenges I faced was ensuring smooth question transitions without reloading the page, which I solved using dynamic DOM manipulation. Managing the timer was another hurdle, as I needed to ensure the quiz ended automatically when time ran out. I implemented a function to stop the quiz and display the final score when the countdown reached zero. Additionally, I refined the user experience by adjusting button placements, adding hover effects, and ensuring a responsive design.

This project significantly improved my JavaScript skills, particularly in event handling and DOM updates. Moving forward, I plan to enhance the quiz by adding difficulty levels, a leaderboard system, sound effects, and more question categories to make it even more engaging. Overall, this internship project was a valuable learning experience, giving me hands-on exposure to frontend web development while allowing me to create something interactive and fun
